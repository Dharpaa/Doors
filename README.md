      ║     Doors     ║
      ╙╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╜
      Doors system.
      Mainly developed in C++.
      My doors use different parameters and curves to be completely unique from each other, 
      allowing designers to create doors with differente feelings for the player to interact with.
      These doors are able to know which entity are they beeing interacted with,
      they do so in order to have different behaviours depending on who opens/closes them.
      Controls:
      E to Open/Close doors.
      
      
      ║     Inspectables     ║
      ╙╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╜
      Inspectable items.
      Mainly developed in C++.
      In this project I coded a component that can be attached to any actor.
      This component allows actors to be interacted by a player and be inspected, which means the player is able to rotate the actor to see it in further detail.
      Not only does this component help the player appreciate little details in objects 
      but it also gives artist and designers the opportunity to hide easter eggs, hidden secrets or clues behind props that would normally be just decoration.
      Controls:
      E to Inspect items.
      Right click to Stop Inspecting items.
      
      
      ║     VRShooter     ║
      ╙╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╍╜
      VR horror static shooter.
      Fully developed in Blueprints.
      I wanted to have a project fully developed in blueprints, since I think they are a powerfull tool that, combined with coding in C++, achieve great results.
      At the same time I´ve always loved Virtual Reality so, I wanted to give it a try.
      The game is playable with or without VR Headset (Tested only in HTC Vive since is the only one I have available)
      In this project I developed a game where the player stands still in the center of a road in a post-apocalyptical world.
      My player has a flashlight on its left hand and a gun on its right one, the player can´t move and can only look around.
      My player also have 3 HP.
      The atmosphere of the game is very dark so the player needs to turn on the flashlight in order to see something more than its feet.
      The gun has 10 bullets that need to be reloaded once the magazine is emptied.
      The flashlight has a battery so that the player can´t have it always on, it´s light starts to dim when the player keeps it on until it turns off, 
      once it´s off, the battery starts reloading.
      Enemies come from across the street.
      There are 2 types of enemies, crawlers and parasites, both of them deal 1 DMG to the player.
      Crawlers are fast crawling creatures that have 3 HP.
      Parasites are bulky slow creatures that have 5 HP.
      Both enemies die in 1 shot if shot to the head.
      This project was made using different props from internet and Mixamo for enemies and animations.
      Controls:
        PC:
        Left click to Shoot
        Space bar to Turn Flashlight On/Off
        R to reload (Needs to be pressed for 2 seconds)
        
        VR:     
        Right Trigger to Shoot
        Left Trigger to Turn Flashlight On/Off
        Right Grip to reload (Needs to be pressed for 2 seconds)
